### Problem Statement
A common issue with PDFs is merging them or separating them into constituent files.
This code handles the former.

### Pre-requisites
<ul>
  <li>Ensure `rake` is installed. This can be done with `gem install rake` (or 
  `gem install rake --no-ri --no-rdoc` if you want to avoid installing the documentation)</li> 
  <li>Files to be merged are in the same directory as the app.</li>
</ul>
